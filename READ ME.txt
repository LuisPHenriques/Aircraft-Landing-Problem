- This file includes 2 folders name IOS and Windows.

- Since mac users are not able to read the files from Excel, we provided a
  separate version, with all data included in the mod and dat file and no need for
  any excell connection for the models in IOS folder.

- IOS folder description:

    - There are 2 folders inside named CP MODELS and MIP MODELS.

    - Both folders include 2 sub-folders for for the Single and Multiple Runways.

    - Each of the sub-folders includes 13 models for airland1 to airland13 (data is uploaded manually in the .mod file).

    - Each model includes the data inside them, so the mac users can easily run the models.

    - All the models for each sub-folder is the same, just the data is different.

    - The MIP models work, however they're not the latest versions as the ones in the Windows folder and in the report.
